PackIt was designed to help travelers by creating a checklist for their packing needs. The app uses the weatherBit API to find the weather conditions around the globe, and renders a packing list based upon those weather conditions. All that is needed is the postal code of the area you are traveling to and the dates that you will be there, the app does the rest. To build this app I utilized HTML, CSS, Javascript and jQuery.
